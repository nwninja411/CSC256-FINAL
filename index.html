            <h1>A Little About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Noah and I am currently pursing a Bachelors in Digital Video at the University of Advancing Technology. I am post-production worker with a passion for telling a visually compelling story. I have a little over 4 years of experience in the Adobe Suite.</p>

            <p>I've always loved going to the movie theatre with family and friends as a kid. I was always fascinated how a team of individuals with different visions could come together and tell a compelling visual story. Watching all these films have inspired me to hopefully join a team like that one day.</p>
                
            <p>The field I work in is the post-production side with primarily editing and putting together the final product. I am proficient in Adobe Premiere pro, Adobe after effects and Adobe Audition. I also have experience in Photoshop, Lightroom, Maya and Nuke.</p>
